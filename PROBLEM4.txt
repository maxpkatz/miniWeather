# Let's start using Nsight Compute to analyze the kernels now that
# we think there's enough work exposed on the GPU. Use the CLI to
# collect a profile of that kernel, and then analyze it in the Nsight
# Compute UI after scp'ing the generated file
# (miniWeather4.nsight-cuprof-report) to your local system.

# TASK 4: what does Nsight Compute tell us is the fundamental
# problem with this loop? Make a simple change to the OpenACC
# parallel loop directive to avoid this issue and improve the
# performance of the loop. (Hint: compare to set_halo_values_x).
# Using the Nsight Systems CLI, verify after making the change
# that this kernel is no longer the most expensive.

# If you're stuck, you can see the solution with
