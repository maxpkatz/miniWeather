# Now that we're running for a long enough time that most of the action is related
# to the GPU, let's use Nsight Systems again to profile the code at the command line
# and collect a timeline.

nsys profile -f true --stats=true -o miniWeather2 ./miniWeather

# TASK 2: use the command line or UI to see that we're spending a lot of time
# in memory copies. We'd like to be able to spend the vast majority of the time
# in compute. Analyze the application driver and determine a simple change you
# can make to remove this bottleneck.

# If you're stuck, you can see the solution with

git apply SOLUTION2.patch
