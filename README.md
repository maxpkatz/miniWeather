# The MiniWeather Mini App

A mini app simulating weather-like flows for training in parallelizing accelerated HPC architectures.
This is a stripped-down version of the main version provided by Matt Norman, and only includes
an OpenACC implementation C. It is intended as a tutorial for learning to use NVIDIA developer tools.

The code can be compiled with make, and currently relies on having the PGI compiler in your environment.
